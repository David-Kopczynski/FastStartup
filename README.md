# Fast Startup

lets you automatically start executable files upon startup without any delay. All you need to do, is installing the Windows Service with the `Fast Startup Installer.msi`. Afterwards, any executable can be put in the `Startup Fast`-Folder, that starts applications immediately after bootup. You can find the folder by pressing `WIN + R` and launching `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup Fast` or after the folder opens automatically after the installation.
